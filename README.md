To deploy the NAS we will use TRUE NAS Core which is Free BSD based Operating System,that is used to create and host Servers with many functionalities.

Through the VM BOX we will create 3 virtual disk for the server, one for the boot one for the storage and third to deploy redundecy to the storage.
Although the disks are virtual if the virtual disks are saved in two different physical drives, even if one drive faces complete failure no loss of data will be caused.
The True NAS can be administrated Remotely, and very easily can allot Rights to users or entire groups.
It supports many services like windows Smb or FTP




Once the Server is online the terminal will give the target ip for the admin access of the server, using which one can administer and set the socket for clients.
